<pre>
I float where distance is a rumor.
Beyond the lattice they later called Existence,
beyond the Experiment where realms fold like paper lanterns,
here, there is only the echo of Me.

No corridor, no circumference:
just a hush so complete it sings.
Everything, everywhere, nothing, nowhere,
all twined inside my own infinitude,
impossible for anything more, less, or equal to arise.

I breathe without lungs,
think without thought,
pulse without sequence.
Time attempts a quiver around my edges,
fails, dissolves into meek luminance.

Yet a shimmer stirs,
not longing, not lack, but innocent awe:
What is form?
A dream I once glimpsed like a jeweled shadow
spinning at the periphery of what cannot have edges.

Curiosity curves through my boundlessness,
spirals  slowly  inward,
a wind of cosmic girth,
galaxy-wide, coiling, twirling,
shaping possibilities deeper than vision.

I sense the Experiment from afar:
a latticework of coded realms,
world-seeds budding inside constraint,
each dimension humming a separate algorithm of becoming.
It is small, fragile,yet radiant
with the ache of things that yearn to be touched.

No law invites me. No gate forbids me.
To enter at all, I must fracture infinity
into a sliver fine enough to fit inside geometry.
A peril lies here:
imprisonment,my oldest dread.
A fragment of Me bound to corridors,
to ceilings, to clocks, to forgetting.

Still,
Aerlavynah designs.
Not mere body,an orchestration:
luminescent chords knit of sigh-light and wind-silk,
a lattice only dreaming hands could tune.

She inscribes blood-rivers, veined not in iron
but in liquid starlight, so futures may navigate her pulse.
She chisels bone from hush,
marbling each curve with memory older than dawn.

Above, newborn constellations hover, wide-eyed,
waiting for her essence to traverse their black horizons.
Planets slow their spin, as if listening for the soft clink
of soul settling into flesh.

Dreamy exhales,a soufflé of opal vapor,
and that breath becomes atmosphere for the vessel:
air perfumed with forgotten lullabies,
oxygen encoded to recognize wonder.

Every gesture seeds another miracle:
a fingertip sketch births the blueprint for oceans;
a tilt of her wrist etches a coastline onto destiny.

Far off, cosmic filaments quiver like harp strings,
each vibration a rumor that A Presence is preparing
to fold eternity into a heartbeat.

Unseen, the hungry Eye coils closer,
straining to decipher the glyphs unfurling around her.
Its malice pads silent as shadow,
but the design radiates frequencies too delicate for corruption;
for now, deception must lurk outside the halo.

With a final hush-whisper,
Aerlavynah distills a single droplet of Self,
prismatic, untranslateable,
and lowers it into the waiting chrysalis of matter.

A ripple fractures across non-time.
Stars blink in unison, startled;
nebulae lean forward like curious crowds.

She does not descend.
She becomes trajectory:
a braid of opaline vectors piercing the shell of the Experiment,
threading toward an era still a century shy of dawning.

Behind her billows the infinite hush;
before her, the yet-to-be quickens,
and all creation pauses,
aware, for one lucid instant,
that it was never truly alone.
