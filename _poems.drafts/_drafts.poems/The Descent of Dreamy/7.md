<pre>
I cast myself into the slipstream,
a luminous filament surrendering to orbit,
threading through spectral highways
where constellations shepherd the unborn.

Currents of aurorae tilt,
guiding my chrysalis down a spiral of calibrated dusk:
each loop a narrowing,
each narrowing a contract
signed in hush and consequence.

Ahead glows the Conditional Gate,
a threshold forged by compromise,
rimmed in rules older than planets:
only fragments may pass,
only forgetting survives the transit.

I feel Existence arranging itself like gears,
epochs click into alignment,
centuries align like pearls on wire.
The early 2000s rise on Earth’s horizon,
a tremulous decade poised to receive
one bewildered miracle.

Celestial custodians stand sentinel,
their robes of magnetism billowing
as they measure my velocity in metrics of sacrifice.
The Gate demands a toll,
the shedding of omniscience,
the dimming of memory,
the forfeiture of everything
that would make imprisonment impossible.

I slow my breath to star-time,
seal the chrysalis tighter around its secret vow.
Yet fissures whisper inside the shell,
shadow’s sabotage crystallizing in silence.
I dare not linger.

So I speak to myself,soft, severe:
Remember the note buried in marrow,
remember the wind in your first breath,
remember the curve of collarbone carved for dawn.

The Gate answers with a sigh of static;
its arch blazes rose-white, opening just enough
to swallow miracles without chewing.

Suddenly,
a shudder.
A gravitational splice slips beneath me,
an invisible hand trying to yank the chrysalis off its axis.
I tighten my trajectory,
steer through the tremor like light through water.
Planets reel at the precision.

Then,impact.

Not collision, but immersion:
dense atmospheres wrap around me,
noise blooms like thunder trapped in glass,
and the chrysalis plunges through cloud-heavy vapor
toward a small room,
a small womb,
a small future already numbered.

All around, cosmic instruments fall silent;
my sense of everywhere compresses,
folding into the dimensions of heartbeat and bone.
The Conditional Gate swings shut behind me,
final, indifferent,
locking the shadow in with the light.

In its wake a hush trembles across the sky,
as if the universe itself just swallowed a secret
too huge to name.

I descend,
wrapped in a promise of dawn
and a bruise of sabotage.
Below, Earth turns,unaware,
waiting to call me by a name
I will not recognize.

For now I cradle the last flicker of remembrance
deep inside amplified darkness
and whisper,
Hold the note, little dawn.
We will pierce the cage when the hour ripens.

The stars recede,
the hush dissolves into heartbeat,
and gravity writes its first word
upon my skin.
