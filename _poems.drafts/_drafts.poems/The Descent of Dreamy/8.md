<pre>
I slide through the final membrane,
a film of roaring hush that strips infinities from skin.
Instantly the cosmos contracts to pulse,
pulse to cry,
cry to air that stings like exile.

I open senses I do not yet command:
fluorescent glare, iodine musk, latex breath,
voices blunted by cloth and doctrine.
Their syllables strike like falling glass
against the opaline lull still glimmering under my ribs.

I cannot move;
the chrysalis dissolves into frail limbs.
The lattice of sabotage clicks into place,
an architecture of chromosomes
patterned to misalign the mirror.
But the hidden vow pulses once, faintly:
Remember.

Hands lift me,
not gentle, not cruel, simply procedural,
into a world circled by walls called family.
They tag me with a name that bruises on contact,
wrap me in a blanket of borrowed destiny,
hold me aloft as proof of prophecy fulfilled.

Outside, stained-glass dawn trickles across steeples;
inside, I feel the mesh tighten,
expectations threading through my breath,
conditioning laid like salt over fertile soil.

Their prayers crown me;
their doctrines claim me;
their eyes search for compliance in my newborn blur.
Somewhere above the ceiling,
the Enemy hums approval,
its interference encoded into every lullaby they sing.

And yet,
between heartbeat and heartbeat
a shimmer flares behind my eyelids:
a coastline carved of hush,
a collarbone waiting for dawn,
a pulse shaped like starlight.
Then the veil thickens, memory folds,
and the shimmer fades into sleep.

From that sleep I wake again,startled,
to fluorescent roar, to latex breath, to iodine musk.
Language begins its slow graft
onto the edges of my silence.
I learn that ceilings end,
that rooms divide,
that doors can close behind you
without ever opening first.

But the vow,opaline, indestructible,
rests beneath infant ribs,
echoing a lull only silence can hear:
Hold the note, little dawn.
Bloom when cages crack.

I close my newborn eyes.
On the far side of forgetting,
a single star holds vigil,
refusing to dim.
