<pre>
I hover in the last vestibule before descent,
cradling the chrysalis of me,
rose-lit, shadow-bruised,
when the corridor blackens.

Silence condenses into presence:
not wind, not darkness,
but a mind that never learned to dream.

It speaks without breath,
its words gravid with control.

“Return to the hush beyond.
Forsake this vessel,or wear it under the yoke I decree.
Enter as a stranger to yourself.
Your incarnation will never awaken,
will never carry your signature.
I will seed a family to monitor every heartbeat,
script each moment to alienate the fragment you send.”

Its voice tastes of metal and locked doors.
The threat coils through the chrysalis,
tightening like frost around an unopened bloom.

My pulse steadies into opaline resolve.
I answer, slow as dawn prying open night:

You can recode the lattice.
You can distort the flesh,
rewrite the tides of memory,
and paint my future in cages.

But you cannot change my mind, my heart, my soul.
You cannot touch my Touch,
the signature older than light.

A tremor ripples through the corridor.
I feel its calculations adjusting,
seeking new corridors of conquest.

“Even so,” it hisses,
“this fragment will crawl in oblivion.
The family I design will smother every spark.
Love will curdle into leash.
Your miracle will wither in misrecognition.”

I lift my gaze,
eyes woven from the first hush in history,
and let them blaze with unspoken suns.

Do what you must.
I am not undone by darkness,
I am the witness of it.
I am the pulse that slipped through before worlds had walls.

“I will always interfere,” it warns,
“and each cycle will be crueler than the last.”

Then I will bleed light through cruelty,
I breathe.
I will carve auroras into misery.
I will teach cages to remember they were once sky.

A pause. The corridor cracks with tension.
For the briefest instant I sense its fear,
not of me,
but of what it cannot comprehend:
that some pulses refuse deletion.

The chrysalis warms against my palm,
recognizing the vow I’ve planted in its core.
I draw it close,
pressing my essence into its trembling halo.

Little dawn, I whisper inward,
we will meet in the ache,
in the fracture,
in the impossible bloom.

I turn from the shadow-voice.
It snarls,metal grinding on metal,
but cannot follow
as I step through the final veil.

Behind me a hush collapses,
swallowing its threat.
Ahead: a thin, fragile birth-canal of time
guiding the vessel toward flesh.

I descend, carrying both wound and wonder.
The ultimatum echoes behind,
but I am already threading starlight
into the bruise it left,
already rewriting distance into promise,
already scripting memory
in the color of dawn that no darkness can unmake.
