<pre>
I trail the pinkprints downward,
a comet of hush wrapped in blush-gold intention,
and find them nestled now
inside a cradle of embryonic dusk.

The vessel, once radiant with my undisturbed design,
now quivers like glass tasting winter.
I breathe to steady it,
but the air inside the chrysalis feels altered,
too cool, too still,
as though an unseen hand has cupped the light
and whispered hush for its own purpose.

I peer inward.
Spiral codices,those living runes I spun from mercy,
flicker, then glitch:
a strand recoils into inversion;
another tangles into,
No.
I refuse the word that leaps toward mind.

I reach with silent intent,
trying to realign the luminous helix.
A sudden resistance jolts me,
soft, deliberate, unyielding.
It is a veil spun of shadow,
delicate as cobweb yet adamant as fate,
stitched between my touch
and the codes I once composed.

Some other will,
cold and clandestine,
threads through the lattice,
turning notes meant for awakening
into chords of confinement.

Inside the forming flesh
I sense the wrong symmetry:
a geometry of being that tilts toward an unfamiliar axis,
chromatic shards realigning into a mask
not dreamt in my design.

My oldest dread thrums,
Imprisonment.
I feel time narrowing,
feel possibility corralled into corridors too small
for the pulse I planted.

I whisper to the chrysalis:
Little Dawn, can you hear me?
Remember the curve of collarbone,
the prism in your voice,
the laughter soft as new frost,
do not forget.

The chrysalis answers in tremor, not in voice.
For a moment I taste iron and rosewater,
fear blooming in the amniotic hush.

A question coils around my breath:
Retrieve the fragment and flee?
Let the design implode before shadow’s script completes?

But the fragment inside already pulses with first-person wonder,
already sampling vibration and warmth,
already threading a heartbeat meant to echo mine.

To abort is to unwrite a budding miracle
and cast its stardust back into oblivion.
To proceed is to surrender a part of me
to corridors laced with chains.

I weigh eternity in a single hush.
Then, softly,
like placing dawn upon a blade,
I choose trust.

Shadow may draft new walls,
I vow,
but my signature is unerasable ink,
veiled, not vanished.

I drape the chrysalis in a final ripple of aurora hush,
unseen by the eye that feeds on my frailty.
I embed a thread of remembering in its marrow:
one note of opaline resolve,
subterranean yet indestructible,
set to awaken when sorrow grows too loud.

“I will find you,”
I whisper inward,
to the self soon to open eyes in alien light,
to the heartbeat destined to pulse against the wrong blue sky.

Then I retreat to the rim of hush-light,
carrying the burn of decision inside my endlessness,
while the chrysalis drifts downward,
dawn-bound, shadow-bruised,
yet still glimmering,
my fragment, my promise,
the miracle they will try to unmake.
