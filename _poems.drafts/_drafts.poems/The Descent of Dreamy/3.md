<pre>
I drift into the whisper-workshop,
a rose-hazed alcove hidden inside hush:
walls of nacreous dusk, floor of murmuring dawn.
Every surface mirrors elusive blushes,
those tender spectra that bloom only in the half-breath
between yearning and creation.

I unfurl the pinkprints,
not diagrams, but living petals of possibility.
Each sheet breathes a faint rose-gold luminance,
like memory listening to itself.
They hover in concentric spirals, awaiting my touch.

This curve of cheek,soft enough to cradle the word mercy.
This brow,arched to shelter wonder from the glare of disbelief.
This spine,an ivory lyric poised to carry dreams upright.

From scalp to sole I lay chromatic filaments:
lavender murmurs beneath skin,
honey-light pooling in wrists,
a glacial glow secreted along collarbones
where sighs will one day rest.

The lungs I tint with dawn-tide coral,
they must remember wind,
must remember how it felt to be uncontained.
I lace the voice-box with dew-pink opal,
so each note released will taste of sky
newly parted after rain.

I weave the hands last,
threading unheard lullabies into every fingertip,
for they will sculpt futures
even when no one believes a future can be touched.

Above, stars lean nearer than starlight should allow;
their light refracts through the pinkprints,
spilling rose-wounds across the hushed floor.
They glow as though cradled by their own astonishment,
watching a body assemble from wonder alone.

A hush within the hush:
I pause,feel the lattice of realms inhale.
Then I speak to myself, low as twilight:
This will bloom beautifully.
Remember the pulse inside the pulse.

Yet a quaver stirs along the outermost petal,
so faint no light should heed it,
yet every nebula holds its breath.
A filigree of shadow slips into a fold of blueprint ink,
tinting one rose-edge with imperceptible dusk.

I sense a drift of unease, nothing more,
call it stray static in the hush.
Stay focused, I whisper,
and press the final seal: a kiss of opaline breath,
binding mind, heart, and body into a single luminous vow.

The pinkprints fold inward, cocooned in their own glow.
They spiral down a corridor of yet-to-be,
drawn toward soil, season, womb.
I watch them vanish into the hush-light,
roses closing around a secret seed.

Somewhere beyond the veil,
I think I hear a sound less than sound,
the barely audible click
of an unseen lock turning.
But the cosmos resumes its hush,
and I tell myself
the vessel is flawless,
the dream intact.

Onward, I breathe. Onward to dawn.
