<pre>
I begin where quiet is more ancient than the word quiet,
a vestibule inside unmeasured night,
so vast that distance curls into itself and becomes a single breath.
Here, I unroll the opaline scroll of intention:
not merely a body, but an opus of thresholds,
each cell a miniature dawn, each lattice a hidden chord.

This curve of collarbone,perfect,
a crescent meant to cradle first light and last longing.
These ribs,arched like a harp of quiet thunder,
hollowed so dreams may ripple through without catching on bone.
Behind them, a heart tuned to resonances older than star-light:
its beat will stain ordinary hours with the aftertaste of infinity.

Voice: I braid opposing silences,
snow-fall hush, violin hush, temple-door hush,
until they shimmer into a timbre capable of subduing oceans
and coaxing thunder into confession.
Laughter must arrive translucent as morning frost on untouched glass,
so grief, encountering it, will soften in astonishment.

Mind: a prism that remembers how to fold paradox into lullabies.
Within that prism I secrete one droplet of unreachable dawn,
enough radiance to ignite a sleeping cosmos in those who hear her,
yet not so fierce as to blind the unready.
Memory palimpsests line her neural corridors:
cartographies of skies no telescope will chart,
whispers of tides from worlds that end before they begin.

I thread future covenants directly into the breath-veins:
,A Sister of Music, woven note by note through her sighs.
,A beloved Valent-one, whose presence will echo her pulse
 with the fidelity of moonlit tide.
,A lineage of tenderness still unborn,
 their laughter waiting like unopened blossoms.
,A horizon where her very breathing will remind strangers
 that stone, too, once learned softness.

Around her skin I drape an atmosphere distilled from aurorae:
crushed prism-dust, first-rain scent, vanished lullabies,
so that each exhale tastes of home long before the word home exists.

Above, nebulae hover in reverent orbit,
their dust-veins brightening as though they’ve remembered an old vow.
Galaxies decelerate, listening for the faint bell-tone
of destiny being tuned beneath an unseen hand.

In the hush beyond hush, I whisper:
This angle,perfect.
This pulse,untenable in its beauty.
Every syllable of the body rings with concealed immensities.

Yet, on the perimeter of my radius, a hairline quiver,
thin as the hesitation between lightning and thunder,
ripples across the design.
Too subtle to name, too delicate to extinguish;
for an instant even the dark forgets its stillness.

I pause.
Infinity leans closer, holding its breath.

Then I press a single droplet of Self,
prismatic, unrefracted,into the waiting chrysalis of matter,
and the fabric of non-time fractures, blossoming outward.

Stars blink in startled synchrony;
nebulae shift their tessellations by a fraction,
and the vast hush around me exhales,
as though it has just learned, for the first time,
what it feels like to hope.

Far beyond vision, something that does not dream
draws nearer,hungry, wordless, patient,
but the vessel gleams on, radiant in its nascent hush,
unaware that shadow has already begun
to trace the edges of its light.

For now, the design is sealed.
All of Existence tilts its head to listen,
and down the uncharted spiral of yet-to-be,
a cradle of flesh begins its slow rotation toward dawn.
