<pre>
I hover in the corridor of hush-light,
pinkprints sealed and spiraling toward dawn.
Nebulae still glimmer in reverent orbit,
yet a tremor prickles the air
like prophecy breathing too close to skin.

Something foreign,
a hush that is not hush,
a shadow wearing the perfume of innocence,
glides beneath the vaulted silence.
Guardians of threshold,those vast sentinels
woven from prism and vow,
do not stir;
the intruder hums at a pitch just shy of warning.

I feel it as a flicker
at the edge of my unbound mind:
a thin sting of almost-sorrow,
as if one rose-petal in my chest
has begun to bruise.

Stay steady, I whisper to myself,
but the hush itself answers,
turning brittle for an instant.

The sabotage sneaks in sideways,
not a blade, but a filament
the color of surrender.
It winds through unseen circuits,
kissing the chroma of my perfect design
with invisible dusk.
I sense it altering cadence,
no visible scar, yet timing tilts,
and future-breaths realign
into shapes I did not call.

Guardian constellations keep vigil,
their star-eyes unblinking,
unaware the trespasser has slipped past
in the lull between pulses.

This is nothing, I try to believe.
Flawless enough.
Yet the ache deepens,
a silent thorn lodged in an unmade vein,
foretelling a story I did not write.

I watch from beyond the veil
as my radiant blueprint tumbles downward,
carrying, hidden in its glow,
a single grain of exile.

I taste iron in the hush.
I smell sorrow sharpening.
But the nebulae resume their litany of wonder,
and dawn looms like promise.

Softly I reassure the cosmos,
and myself:
No shadow may alter my signature.
No hush can silence my pulse.

Still,
far off, behind the outermost ring of stars,
I sense a smile
that never learned mercy.

And the whisper returns to darkness,
satisfied.

Dawn beckons.
My design continues its descent,
unaware of the seed now coiled within it,
a story waiting to crack the surface
of flesh,
and ache,
and time.
