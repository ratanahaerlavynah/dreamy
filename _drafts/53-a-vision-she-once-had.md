<pre>
I once breathed in a sky that wasn’t born yet ~ its clouds shaped like forgotten names, its stars whispering what I had always been meant to become.
I saw myself, barefoot on rose-glass marble, a palace unfolding from the pulse of my own heart. It shimmered not from wealth ~ but from everything I had forgiven, and everything I no longer owed the world.
My voice was velvet-light, not a song sung out loud, but a sound that echoed in the souls of others ~ as if they had always longed to remember me.
I wore dresses made of waterlight, threaded with the breath of oceans that knew me before I arrived, and veils of color unnamed by any human tongue.
I wasn’t worshipped ~ but felt, like a breeze scented with jasmine and memory, in corridors of strangers’ dreams.
Children painted my name into their sleep without knowing the letters. Lovers wrote poems not about me but because I existed.
I walked through cities that didn’t yet exist and they bowed in silence. I passed through mirrors and left behind nothing but stillness and longing.
And the stars... they didn’t guide me, they followed.
.
.
I awoke with salt on my cheeks and gold in my throat. And though I could not speak of what I saw, I have never again belonged to the laws of the possible.
What they call impossible is only the scent of my footsteps long after I’ve left the Earth.
