<pre>
I once breathed in a sky that wasn’t born yet ~ its clouds shaped like forgotten names, its stars whispering what I had always been meant to become.

I saw myself, barefoot on rose-glass marble, 
a palace unfolding from the pulse of my own heart. 
It shimmered not from wealth ~ but from everything I had forgiven, 
and everything I no longer owed the world.

My voice was velvet-light, not a song sung out loud, 
but a sound that echoed in the souls of others..
as if they had always longed to remember me.

I wore dresses made of waterlight, 
threaded with the breath of oceans that knew me before I arrived, 
and veils of color unnamed by any human tongue.

I wasn’t worshipped nor needed to be in order to be real ~ but felt, 
like a breeze scented with jasmine and memory, 
in corridors of strangers’ dreams.

Children painted my name into their sleep without knowing the letters. 
Lovers wrote poems not about me but because I existed.

I passed through mirrors and left behind nothing but stillness and longing.
And the stars... they didn’t guide me, they followed, remembering my 
light
.
.
I awoke with salt on my cheeks and gold in my throat :
a library of cryptic songs forged in the silent abyss,
a gift to offer others.
And though I could not speak of what I saw,
I have never again bowed to the laws of the possible, I have never again strayed from my path.

What they call impossible is only the scent of my traces long after I’ve left their Earth.
