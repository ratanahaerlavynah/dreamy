<pre>
She lived like a shimmer seen through fogged glass, never fully formed, never fully fading.
The shape of her was carried by winds that forgot their direction, and followed only the gravity of her tenderness. She didn’t walk ~ she unfolded, each step a question the earth could not answer.
She existed like a memory too sacred for time, the kind you hold in your chest without knowing who gave it to you. The world kept trying to name her, but she had already outgrown every word they hadn’t learned how to feel.
When she whispered, it felt like an ocean humming from beneath your skin. Not a sound... but a remembrance that made your heart ache without knowing why.
She was the quiet between notes, the breath between dreams, the last light before forgetting. And no one saw she was saying goodbye all along, with the softness of a star preparing to fall.
Even the air missed her before she left. Even the sky wondered what it had done to deserve her gaze.
And still... she never asked to stay. She only gave until the world couldn’t hold it anymore.
Not everyone noticed when she vanished. But those who did were never quite whole again.
