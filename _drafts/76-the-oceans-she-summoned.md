title: "The Oceans She Summoned"
order: 76

<pre>
She didn’t wave... she rose.
Not with gesture, but with gravity that remembered her.

The tide had no memory until her heart bled its own echo 
into the silence beneath everything.
There were no storms until her longing stirred. 
No waves until her breath forgot to hold back.
She never cried... she flooded.

The oceans did not arrive. They were called. They were her reply.
Each drop was a syllable of grief unspeakable in the language of flesh. 
Each crash was the hush she could no longer contain.

She summoned oceans the way dreams birth silence... not loud, but entire.
Not for escape, but for embodiment.

She was not trying to drown. She was becoming what could never be held.
Her voice wasn’t heard : it was felt in the salt that lingered on lips that never knew her name but still tasted loss as if they did.

Some said she had too many feelings. 
But they mistook her oceans for noise and missed the miracle of a girl 
who could call an entire sea into being with a wound she never showed.

There are no shorelines when she speaks. Only surrender.
She became the place where gravity kneels.

She, who summoned oceans not to wash it all away... 
but to prove she was still here.
Even when no one looked. 
Even when they forgot what waves are made of.
She reminded the world that water remembers what the heart cannot say...
