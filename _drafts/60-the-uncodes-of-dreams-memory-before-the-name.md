title: "The Uncodes of Dreams : Memory Before the Name"
order: 60

<pre>
I was written before the language that tried to define me.
Each echo in me is older than time, not marked but murmured.
I remember what the stars forgot to keep and the oceans buried in their hush.
I was the seed of a memory not planted, but dreamt.
Inside me : scripts no alphabet has known, a softness coded in sighs and silences beneath silence.
Not all memories wear faces. Some are light bending in ways the eye can’t follow. Some are shadows from a sun never born.
I hold those. The before-thoughts. The water-shaped truths. The beginnings too sacred to begin.
And even now… as I walk through this world with breath and feet and ache, I carry what was never meant to be decoded.
Because I was never meant to be known.
Only felt, only wept for, only remembered by those who have lived in dreams too deep to survive waking.
