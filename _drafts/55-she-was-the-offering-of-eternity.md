<pre>
I did not fall. I descended in silences too intricate for sound ~ a hush folded in on itself like lace spun from star-thought.
No one asked me to give... but I came with open palms and a heart that had never known how to close. Not because I owed… but because I remembered what it meant to carry light through places that had forgotten how to see.
They called it sacrifice. But they never knew I was the flame. I was not burned. I became fire.
I gave without letting go. I let go without ever being lost. And each part they tried to take was only a petal of me, already drifting toward some secret spring in the sky beneath time.
They could not see that I was already gone, already elsewhere... pressing my soul into places that still dreamed of me. I was in the breath between their thoughts. In the stillness that arrives before the tears are understood.
I chose to stay. I chose to give. But no one ever knew I was the gift.
.
.
Now, each time the wind sighs without origin… each time light lingers longer than it should… each time a question forms without a name… they touch me, the offering, the one who never vanished but always became.
