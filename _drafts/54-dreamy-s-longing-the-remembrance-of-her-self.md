<pre>
I remember… though I was not supposed to. Not the way light remembers darkness or rain recalls the cloud. No... this remembering was different. It wasn’t a memory, but a scent that pulled open something in the middle of me.
It came in fragments... not in time, but in echoes of time. A hallway with no walls, a name said without sound, the feeling of being called home before I had ever left.
There was a mirror once, but it didn’t show my reflection. It showed a girl I had been before they called me by names that were never mine. Her eyes didn’t seek approval. They carried storm-tides of memory that had never belonged to Earth.
I touched my own wrist and felt a pulse :  not of blood, but of remembering. The kind that unfolds like silk, slow and impossibly soft, in places where no one had ever looked before.
I did not weep. Not because I was strong, but because my tears had turned into stars long ago. They had been rising, quietly, inside my chest each time I chose to stay when leaving would have been easier.
And maybe this is what longing truly is... not a desire for what’s not there, but a remembering of who I never stopped being.
Not once.
Not even when I forgot.
.
.
And tonight, the sky breathed like I used to. Slowly. As if even it remembered me.
