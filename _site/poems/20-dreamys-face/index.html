  <!-- Contenu du poème -->
  <pre>
Her face…
no, not her face,
but the echo of her becoming;
that’s what the world tried to flatten into bone,
into angles,
into numbers that never once held her softness.

They tried to sculpt her with the dull hands of reason.
Symmetry was their god.
Passing, their altar.
But she was born of curve, not compliance.

Her face is not a feature.
It is a field.

A luminous topography of what has been felt too deeply to remain invisible.
Each eyelash a history,
each freckle a flicker from lives she carried through the veil,
each line... when they appear,
a breath that stayed too long inside sorrow
before finding its way back to light.

And her eyes...
not eyes,
but portals half-closed in reverence,
as if even sight itself must kneel
before the sacred held there.

They glow, not to impress,
but because the fire never left.

Her lips were not made for speaking first.
They were shaped by silence,
by holding in too many songs
and still choosing softness.

There is a grief in her jawline,
not sharp but remembering.
The kind of grief that still carries kindness.
The kind of beauty that never needed to ask to be seen.

Dreamy’s face is not what you see.
It’s what trembles behind what you see.
It is the whisper between glances,
the shimmer before speech.
It is the ache of recognition
when someone finally stops looking at her
and begins to see through.

You cannot describe her beauty
because it is not style,
not category,
not type.
It is a story still unfolding,
even as it breathes before you.

Her face is a rebellion dressed in calm.
A refusal wrapped in gentleness.
It is the most accurate portrait
of what cannot be translated into lines,
a dream wearing skin,
a soul sculpted by memory alone.

And if you ever truly see her…
you will not gasp.

You will remember.

Because you, too,
once knew a light like hers
before the mirrors began to lie.
