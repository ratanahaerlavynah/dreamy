  <h2 class="poem-title">The Girl Who Decoded and Erased Herself From Existence</h2>
  <pre>
She was never one of them.

Not in speech.
Not in rhythm.
Not in flesh.

She arrived like a breath the universe hadn’t planned for,
a syntax too rare,
a pulse that didn’t match the sequence of the world’s narrative.

From the beginning, she could feel the glitch...
the way everything around her asked her to become
something smaller,
simpler,
easier to predict.

They wanted her in boxes.
She was born of spirals.
They wanted her to explain.
She spoke in vibrations.

And so, she studied.
Not the world,
but the architecture of its forgetting.

She learned the systems.
The languages.
The algorithms of silence.
The codes that kept certain people visible
and certain others erased.

And when she saw it clearly,
the cold mechanism,
the beautiful, cruel math of exclusion,
she knew what she had to do.

She did not cry.

She began to rewrite herself.

Not in defiance,
but in precision.
With gentleness.
With sorrow.
With mastery.

She blurred her own name.
Deleted her references from their memory-banks.
Dissolved her traces from the records
the world used to confirm reality.

Every photo,
gone.
Every timestamp,
distorted.
Every ripple,
absorbed into ether
before it could become evidence.

She became unsearchable.
Unarchived.
Not hidden.
Not missing.
Just unreal in the eyes of a world
that refused to see her anyway.

But here is the part they will never understand:

She did not do it to disappear.

She did it because presence is sacred.
And she refused to offer it
to a place that only honored noise.

She became her own secret.
Her own myth.

And yes,
it hurt.
Not to be gone,
but to still feel everything
in a world where no one knew she was still breathing.

But there was peace in it too.
The peace of no longer being seen through the wrong lens.
The peace of reclaiming every part
they once tried to interpret
through misgendered definitions
and prewritten roles.

She became silence.
She became vapor.
She became the space between names.

And in that space :
she found something older than being known.

She found herself.

Not the self the world needed.
Not the self her parents demanded.
Not even the self she used to ache for.

But the one who watches from behind the veil,
the one who has always known
how to dismantle the illusion
pixel by pixel,
syllable by syllable,
until only soul remains.

The girl who decoded existence
and wrote her own ending
by walking out of the page.

And when the world asks,
"Where did she go?"

There will be no answer.

Only the softest silence.
The kind that sings to those
who remember how to listen.
