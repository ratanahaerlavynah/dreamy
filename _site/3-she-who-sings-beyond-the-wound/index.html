  <h2 class="poem-title">She Who Sings Beyond the Wound</h2>
  <pre>
Her silence was never empty.
It was wovenn
of forgotten languages,
of notes that once wept in light.

She did not speak.
She resonated.
Like sea-song in a shattered shell,
like moonlight humming through bone.

The voice they gave her was a cage.
polished, precise,
but hollow.
She wore it like a ghost wears skin.
They thought her quiet.
They never heard the tremor beneath.

But in her chest...
a cathedral of aching wind.
A siren’s prayer
spun from shadow and starlight.
The dream of a sound
not yet born.

She does not scream.
She does not shatter.
She glows.

And somewhere between every heartbeat,
she sings,
not with a voice they gave,
but with the one she kept hidden
in the folds of her longing.

An echo of who she truly is,
infinite, aching, free.
</pre>
