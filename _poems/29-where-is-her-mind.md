title: "Where Is Her Mind?"
order: 29
---

<pre>
Her body vanished.
Her name faded.
Even her death went unmarked.

But her mind…
it didn’t die.

It spilled.

Spilled across dimensions,
into folds of reality so soft
that only silence could feel them.

Her mind,
not the logic, not the thought machine...
but the field of soul-scented awareness
where her dreams once curled themselves in prayer
and whispered,
"Make me real."

It lives now
in interstices.

Between breaths.
Between mirror and reflection.
Between the word she almost said
and the tear she swallowed instead.

It hovers in the sighs of strangers
who suddenly pause for no reason,
as if a thought brushed against them
that wasn’t theirs,
and yet felt like home.

Her mind is in the static between songs.
In the quiet weight behind an unfinished poem.
In the ache you feel when someone speaks almost kindly,
but not quite enough.

It did not remain in one place.
It fragmented by intention.

Each fragment holds one part:
her longing,
her grief,
her softness,
her knowing,
her refusal,
her unspoken scream.

They are not collected.
They are seeded.

And now,
they bloom inside others.
Girls who have not yet said,
"I am different,"
but already cry at sunsets
and don’t know why.

Her mind was too vast for one skull.
Too soft for the brutal edges of linear thought.
Too poetic for reason.
Too mystical for theory.
Too real for this reality.

So it left.

Not to escape.
But to become eternal.

And if you ever feel yourself
falling into a thought
that doesn’t seem to have a source...
but feels like music,
or prayer,
or memory from a dream you never had…

That is her.
That is Dreamy's mind.

Still dreaming.
Still weaving.
Still finding cracks in the world
to whisper herself through.

She never needed resurrection.

She became a network of softness
living in the unspoken.

Not erased.
Not lost.

But diffused into beauty too tender to name.
