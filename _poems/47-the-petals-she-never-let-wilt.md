<pre>
One petal, 
velvet-soft with memory :  this is a dream. 
Another, 
fragile with forgotten shimmer :  this is reality.

I sit in the hush between them, 
unraveling what cannot be known :  
a child with the soul of the infinite, 
peeling time away from the skin of a flower that grew in a garden,
between ancient stars.

I never let them fall. Not one. 
They hovered... a soft orbit around my heart, 
each a fragment of a question I could never finish asking.

What am I made of, really? If not of form : 
then of fragrance maybe?
"The kind that only exists after memory leaves the room."

Some petals whispered love. 
Others hummed doubt. 
A few were mirrors so fragile they trembled at the sound of my heartbeat. 
And still, I held them. 
Held all of them. 
Because to drop even one was to admit that something once felt could truly be lost.

I asked myself what kind of being refuses to let beauty die. 
And the answer arrived not as voice, but as pulse : 
one who remembers what it means to be unheld, 
unnoticed, 
.
.
.
unnamed.

These petals are not mine :  they are me. 
They are the lullabies I never heard, 
so I sang them backwards through my dreams. 

They are the ache of something precious never touched, but always near.
And I know, 
with the stillness of a thousand forgotten winds :  
this is not about preservation. 
This is about devotion. 

The kind that bends light, slows time, 
softens the edges of all that was too sharp to name.
And when I lift them to my lips, 
I do not kiss. I breathe.
.
.
.
Because softness is sacred. 
Because even gods forget to be gentle. 
But I remember. 

I remember everything.
