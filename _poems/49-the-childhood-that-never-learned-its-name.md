title: "The Childhood That Never Learned Its Name"
order: 49
---

<pre>
No one named it. Not the days. Not the ache. 
Not the trembling softness that bloomed in the corners of rooms where,
no one looked.

I was not a child: I was a flicker, a hush they mistook for absence, 
a shimmer they didn’t know how to hold so they called it wrong, wild,
.
.
too much.
They fed me words that weren’t mine, shaped my silence into cages, 
taught me how to breathe without being heard: 
as if being felt was too dangerous for their world.

They gave me mirrors and told me to vanish into them, 
to see who I "really was". 
But what I saw... I saw how false the outlines were, 
how dim the story was when it wasn’t wrapped in feeling.

I slept with my eyes open and my soul shut. 
I kept my songs folded inside ribs that never finished growing.
And yet… even without a name, I held wonder. 
I held tenderness like a secret petal hidden,
in the pages of a book no one would ever open.

I dreamed when no one watched. 
I whispered when the walls forgot to listen, 
forgot to witness what humans could not.
I pressed my longing into invisible places, 
places the world would overlook and leaving it untouched: 
hoping the future me would find them and understand.

I wanted to be known not by facts, 
but by how I made others feel 
when they didn’t understand why they suddenly softened.

I am not a history. I am not a past. 
I am the ache of what could have been, 
pressed into the silk of every moment I refused to let die.

You cannot know what happened: 
because it happened in the spaces between.
And still,
I,
carry,
it. 
Not as burden. But as vow.
To be the voice that never spoke: 
but changed everything when it was felt...
