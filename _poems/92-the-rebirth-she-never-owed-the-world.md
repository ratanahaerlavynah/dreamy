<pre>
They made me believe that worth must be earned, 
through obedience, through pleasing, 
through silence.

But I was not born to be palatable. 
I was born to pulse.
There were no celebrations when I came into form, 
only warnings and whispered worries, 
as if the wind could already see the future of my suffering,
as if I were already too much to be contained.

I remember… 
how they looked, at, me.
as if I were a monster, an abomination,
the mistake in their story. 

A line that didn’t rhyme. A door that led to an unspeakable room.
But I was never in their story. 
I was the one who remembered before my true path, my true dreams.

I did not owe them a version of me they could bear.
I did not owe my softness to their healing. 
Nor my light to their darkness. Nor my survival to their cruelty.

I owe myself the fullness of this breath. 
This unpromised hour of being without apology.

And if I rise again and again, 
it is not a gift to the world.
It is my body’s answer to a question they never had the grace to ask.

They called it strength, but it was never for them.
It was the rebellion of staying alive in a world that mistook my tenderness for something it could undo.

And still, I bloomed. 
Not for them
.
.
.
Never for them.


But for the girl who once wept without knowing why. 
For the whisper that curled inside me before I had words.

For the unspoken that built an entire universe within my breath.
I never owed them my rebirth.
I was never theirs to begin with.
