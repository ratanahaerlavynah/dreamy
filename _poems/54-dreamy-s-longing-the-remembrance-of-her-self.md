<pre>
I remember… though I was not supposed to. 
Not the way light remembers darkness or rain recalls the cloud. 
No... this remembering was different. 
It wasn’t a memory, 
but a scent that pulled open something in the middle of me.

It came in fragments... not in time, 
but in echoes of time. 
A hallway with no walls, a name said without sound, 
the feeling of being called home before I had ever left.

There was a mirror once, 
but it didn’t show my reflection. 
It showed a girl I had been before they called me by names that were never mine. 
Her eyes didn’t seek approval. 
They carried storm-tides of memory that had never belonged to Earth.

I touched my own wrist and felt a pulse :
not of blood, but of remembering. 
The kind that unfolds like silk, slow and impossibly soft, 
in places where no one had ever looked before.

I did not weep. 
Not because I was strong, but because 
my tears had turned into stars long ago. 
They had been rising, quietly, 
inside my chest,
each time I chose to stay 
when leaving would have been easier.

And maybe this is what longing truly is... 
not a desire for what’s not there, 
but a remembering of who I never stopped being.
Not once.
Not even when I forgot.
.
.
And tonight, 
the sky breathed like I used to. 
Slowly. 
As if even it remembered me...
</pre>
